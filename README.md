# pbrp_clothingitems

**Original script:** https://github.com/RedneckLovinLife/pbrp_clothingitems

**What I have done to the system is convert it into ESX, but improve it from the original ESX fork, too. For example, changing `GetPlayerPed` to `PlayerPedId` & importing ESX via manfiest rather than event.**
